1.‘Fare’ is a float and we have to deal with 4 categorical features: Name, Sex, Ticket and Embarked. Lets investigate and transfrom one after another.
Fare:
Converting “Fare” from float to int64, using the “astype()” function.

2.Name:
We will use the Name feature to extract the Titles from the Name, so that we can build a new feature out of that.

3.Sex:
Convert ‘Sex’ feature into numeric.

4.Since the Ticket attribute has unique tickets, it will be a bit tricky to convert them into useful categories. So we will drop it from the dataset.

5.Embarked:
Convert ‘Embarked’ feature into numeric.

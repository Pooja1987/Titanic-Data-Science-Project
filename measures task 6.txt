As we can see, the Random Forest classifier goes on the first place. But first, let us check, how random-forest performs, when we use cross validation.

Mean: 0.811929012345679
Standard Deviation: 0.054304766184152746

This looks much more realistic than before. Our model has a average accuracy of 81% with a standard deviation of 5 %. The standard deviation shows us, how precise the estimates are .
 started training different machine learning models, picked one of them (random forest) and applied cross validation on it.
